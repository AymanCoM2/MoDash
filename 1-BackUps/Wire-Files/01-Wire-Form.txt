1- Creating the LiveWire Components : [VWR]
    $ php artisan make:livewire Componentvr
    {
        This Command will have Two parts :
        [ Class -> Has Data and Logic ]
        [ View -> A reactive html Component which you Can Embed in any Place  ]

        This Means For Example you Can Make Comments Section a [ LiveWire Component ] And Rest of Page is Normal Blade But this Means when Embeding this LiveWire-Compoent inside this Balde it will be "Reactive Component"
    }
